## Preview the site

To preview the website locally:

1. Install [Ruby and Bundler](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/) if you don't have them already.

1. `cd` to the repository directory and run the following command:

```
$ cd docs
$ bundle install
```

Bundler will look in the Gemfile for which gems to install.

## Run and view site locally

Run Jekyll using the following command:

```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then, load [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) in your browser.
