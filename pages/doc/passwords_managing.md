If your company has an SSO integration enabled (ADFS, Google, Okta, OneLogin), then you will be unable to update your password utilizing this flow. You will need to contact your company administrator in order to update your password.

## Changing Your password

To change your password:

1. Browse to your Wavefront instance URL.
1. Log in.
1. Click the gear icon <i class="fa fa-cog"></i> on the task bar and select your username. Your User Profile displays.
    1. In the User Information section, click the **Change Password** link.
    1. Type the current password once and the new password twice. 
    1. Click **Save**.

## Resetting a Forgotten Password

To reset a forgotten password:

1. Browse to your Wavefront instance URL.
1. Click the **Forgot Password** link.
1. Enter the email address associated with your Wavefront account.
1. Click **Send Password Recovery Email**. Email containing a link to reset the password is sent to your account. The link associated with the reset password email expires after 24 hours. You will need to repeat steps 1-3 if you do not reset your password within that time frame.
