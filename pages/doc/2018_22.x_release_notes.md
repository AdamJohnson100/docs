2018-22.x release highlights:
* Improved event performance
* Enhanced support for Amazon CloudTrail events
* Miscellaneous improvements


## Improved Event Performance
This release includes several improvements to event performance. The improvements are especially noticable if you don't use wildcards and you don't use `NOT`.

To get this significant performance improvement, you'll see some changes:
* You cannot create more than 1000 ongoing user events.
* If you create an event with an end time, then you can no longer make changes to the event name or other event properties later.
* Any ongoing event that is created after upgrade to release 2018.22x is closed after 60 days.
* Any ongoing event that is created before upgrade to release 2018.22x is closed after 60 days.

This release also tracks more events than earlier releases. See [When Does an Event Query Return Events?](http://docs.wavefront.com/events_queries.html#when-does-an-event-query-return-events)

## Enhanced Support for Amazon CloudTrail

With this release, the Amazon CloudTrail integration groups events by the minute and allows you to use the event metrics in queries from the Wavefront UI. Each metric starts with `aws.cloudtrail.event.`. You can filter the metrics using the following point tags that are also new in this release:

* `eventType`
* `eventSource`
* `awsRegion`
* `accountID`
* `_count`

See [CloudTrail Events, Metrics and Point Tags](integrations_aws_metrics.html#cloudtrail-events-metrics-and-point-tags) for details. 

## Miscellaneous Improvements

* If you perform direct ingestion, you can now specify the data format as `wavefront`, that is, `f=graphite_v2` changes to `f=wavefront`. The old format is deprecated but still works initially.
* The `aliasSource()` function uses regex replacements or node extraction to generate source names. These source names are now converted to lowercase to maintain consistent behavior for series matching. When you use `aliasSource()` with a static string (e.g. `aliasSource(ts(<metric.name>), "Source.Test")`, source names retain their original case.
* Trial users can now invite additional new users from within their trial.
