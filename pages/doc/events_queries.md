You use `events()` queries to [display events in charts](charts_events_displaying.html). An `events()` query cannot be the only query on the chart; at least one time series must be enabled on the chart in addition to the `events()` query to display the events.

## Event Query Syntax

events(\[<span style="color: #00BCD4;">\<filterName\>="\<filterValue\>"</span>\] \[<span style="color: #eb7a3d;">and\|or\|not</span> <span style="color: #00BCD4;">\<filterName\>="\<filterValue\>"</span>\]])

where <span style="color: #00BCD4;">\<filterName\></span> is one of the supported [event filters](#filters).

You can specify multiple <span style="color: #00BCD4;">event filters</span> separated by boolean operators (<span style="color: #eb7a3d;">and</span>, <span style="color: #eb7a3d;">or</span>, <span style="color: #eb7a3d;">not</span>). You can use a comma instead of the boolean operator <span style="color: #eb7a3d;">and</span>. You cannot create `events()` queries in the [Query Builder](query_language_query_builder.html).

## Example Queries

- `events(name="Request\*" and (severity="severe" or severity="warn")`  or `events(name="Request\*", severity="warn" or severity="severe")` - Display user events or events based on any alerts that start with `Request` and are either severity `severe` or `warn`.

- `events(severity="warn" or source="app-1")` - Display events with severity `warn` or generated by the source `app-1`.

## When Does an Event Query Return Events?

Where an event happens in relation to the query start time  and query end time determines whether a query returns an event or not. Returning an event means showing the event in the UI, or, if you use the API, returning the event itself. The following illustration illustrates the behavior:

Here are some details. Note that for two cases, the behavior changed in Wavefront 2018.10; however, the following table shows general behavior and does not focus on this (fairly minor) change.

|**Event Number** | **Event start** | **Event end** | **Returned?** |
|Event 1 | Before query start time time | Before query start time | No |
|Event 2 | After query start time | Before query end time  | Yes  |
|Event 3 | Before query start time | After query start time  | Yes  |
|Event 4 | Before query start time  | After query end time | No(*) |
|Event 5 | Before query start time | N.A. (ongoing event) | No(*) |
|Event 6 | After query start time  | After query end time | Yes  |
|Event 7 | After query end time | N.A. (ongoing event) | No  |
|Event 8 | After query start time | N.A. (ongoing event)  | Yes  |
|Event 9 | After query end time | After query end time  | No |

(*) Wavefront returned the event before 2018.10, but we no longer return it. Performance improvements are significant.

## More Info

You can use `events()` functions to fine-tune your events query. For examples, see [Advanced events() Expressions](events_queries_advanced.html) and for a general reference, see [Event Functions](query_language_reference.html#event-functions).
