## Description

The `mpercentile()` function computes the percentile value of each data stream over a moving time window. The percentile value must be between 0 and 100.
Unlike other Moving Time functions, the `mpercentile()` function also requires a `percentileValue`.

## Example

The following simple example shows 75th percentile value for disk space during the last 10 days. We're showing an 8 day time window in this chart.

The following example uses the same query but with a focus on the app servers. This chart also shows an 8 day time window.
