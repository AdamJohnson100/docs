[Charts](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1064) are the primary way you view the status of your metrics. You add [ts() queries](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1019)
to view and perform operations on metrics and configure [chart options](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1158) for the most helpful view.

Dashboards group a set of related charts. Dashboards allow you to share [display preferences](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1068#jive_content_id_Setting_Dashboard_Preferences), [variables](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1062), and [overlay events](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1063) across all the charts contained in the dashboard.  Within dashboards use can use [sections](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1068#jive_content_id_Configuring_Dashboard_Sections)
to further organize charts.

## Interacting with Dashboards and Charts

Wavefront provides many ways to [interact with dashboards and charts](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1067). For both dashboards and charts you can change time windows, share links, apply queries, isolate sources, and zoom in and out. Within a chart you can isolate individual series and use hot keys to see full precision values and fish-eye views at the cursor.

You can create a dashboard from scratch or starting from a single chart, a set of metrics, an existing dashboard, or a JSON definition.
