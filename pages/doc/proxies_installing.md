summary: Learn how to install and run Wavefront proxies.
---
In most cases, a Wavefront proxy must be running in your installation before metrics begin streaming to Wavefront from a host or application.

You can install a proxy as part of an [in-product integration](integrations.html#in-product-integrations) or standalone. This topic describes various methods for installing Wavefront proxies and for managing proxy services.

Installation procedures might require a Wavefront API URL `<wavefront_api_url>` in the format `https://<wavefront_instance>.wavefront.com/api/` and an API token. To get an API token, see [Generating an API Token](wavefront_api.html#generating-an-api-token).

**Note** Some installation procedures automatically configure these properties for you.

## Proxy Host Requirements

- Internet access - run `timeout 3s curl -fIsS <wavefront_api_url>` from the host and make sure you get a response rather than a time-out.
- Memory - you don't need a dedicated the host for running the Wavefront proxy. The proxy does not use a lot of CPU, memory, or storage. However, we recommend running the proxy on a host with at least 4GB of free memory.
- Operating system
  - Linux
    - Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, 16.04
    - CentOS 6.5, 7
    - RHEL 6, 7
    - Debian 7, 8, 9, 10
    - Amazon Linux
  - Mac - MacOS Sierra (10.12)
  - Windows - Windows 8 and later

## Installing a Proxy on a Single Host

To install and run a proxy on a Linux, Mac or Windows host, or in a Docker container on a host:

1. Open the Wavefront application UI.
1. Select **Browse > Proxies**.
1. Select **Add > New Proxy** at the top of the filter bar. The Add a Wavefront Proxy screen displays.
1. Click the **\[Linux \| Mac \| Windows \| Docker ]** tab.
1. (Windows Only) Download the proxy. 
1. Copy the script and run it on your host.

   **Note** On Windows, do not run the installer .exe. Run the script instead. 
1. After the proxy contacts the Wavefront server, the proxy name displays under "Checking for new proxies..." and the button label changes to **Done**.
1. Click **Done**. The Proxies page displays. Verify that your proxy is listed. If not, follow the steps in [Managing Proxy Services](#managing-proxy-services) to make sure the proxy is running.

## Installing Proxies on Multiple Linux Hosts

Ansible is an open-source automation engine that automates software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment. The Wavefront Ansible role installs and configures the Wavefront proxy, which allows you to automate Wavefront proxy installation on multiple Linux hosts. For details, see the [Ansible in-product integration](integrations.html#in-product-integrations) setup instructions.

## Managing Proxy Services

After installing a proxy, you can start and stop the proxy service, check service status, and view the logs that are generated by the service. See [Logging](proxies_configuring.html#logging) for log configuration options.

If a proxy doesn't start or doesn't [register with Wavefront](proxies_managing.html#viewing-registered-proxies) and you need help, contact [Support]({{site.support_link}}). Consider checking [Proxy Troubleshooting](proxies_installing.html#troubleshooting) first.

### Starting and Stopping a Proxy

Run the following commands on the proxy host:

- Linux

  ```shell
  $ service wavefront-proxy [start | stop | restart]
  ```
- Mac

  ```shell
  $ brew services [start | stop | restart] wfproxy
  ```
- Docker

  ```shell
  $ docker [start | stop ] <proxy_container_id>
  ```
- Windows

  ```
  $ cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Wavefront\bin
  $ ./nssm.exe [start | stop] WavefrontProxy
  ```

### Checking Proxy Service Status

To check if the proxy is running, run the following commands on the proxy host:

- Linux

  ```shell
  $ service wavefront-proxy status
  ```
  You can view the proxy log at `/var/log/wavefront/wavefront.log`.
- Mac

  ```shell
  $ brew services list
  ```
  You can view the proxy log at `/usr/local/var/log/wavefront/wavefront.log`.
- Docker

  ```
  $ docker ps
  ```
  To view the proxy log, run `docker logs <proxy_container_id>`.
- Windows

  ```
  $ cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Wavefront\bin
  $ ./nssm.exe status WavefrontProxy
  ```
  You can view the proxy log at `Program Files (x86)\Wavefront\wavefront.log`.

### Testing a Proxy

You can test that a proxy is receiving and sending data by sending it a JSON payload as follows:

1. In the [proxy configuration file](proxies_configuring.html), set the JSON listener port to 3878.

   ```
   jsonListenerPorts=3878
   ```
1. Run the following command:

   ```shell
   curl --header "Content-type: application/json" \
   'http://<wavefront_proxy_address>:3878/?h=test_host&d=now' \
   -d '{"test.metric":{"value":1,"tags":{"key1":"v1","key2":"v2"}}}'
   ```
   where `<wavefront_proxy_address>` is the address of your Wavefront proxy.
1. In the Wavefront UI, select **Browse > Metrics**.
1. In the Metrics field, type `test.metric`.
1. Click `test.metric` to display a chart of the metric.

## Running a Proxy in a Docker Container

To run a Docker container using the Docker run command, follow the instructions in [Installing a Proxy on a Single Host](#single). If you want to use Docker Compose or Kubernetes to run the proxy, set the `WAVEFRONT_URL` and `WAVEFRONT_TOKEN` properties, as follows:.

### Docker Compose

```yaml
wavefront:  
    hostname: wavefront-proxy
    container_name: wavefront-proxy
    ports:  
      - "3878:3878"
      - "2878:2878"
      - "4242:4242"
    environment:
      WAVEFRONT_URL: <wavefront_api_url>
      WAVEFRONT_TOKEN: <wavefront_api_token>
    image: wavefronthq/proxy:latest
    restart: always
```

### Kubernetes

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  labels:
    app: wavefront-proxy
    name: wavefront-proxy
  name: wavefront-proxy
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    app: wavefront-proxy
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wavefront-proxy
    spec:  
      containers:
      - name: wavefront-proxy
        image: wavefronthq/proxy:latest
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        env:
        - name: WAVEFRONT_URL
          value: <wavefront_api_url>
        - name: WAVEFRONT_TOKEN
          value: <wavefront_api_token>
        ports:  
        - containerPort: 2878
          protocol: TCP
        - containerPort: 4242
          protocol: TCP
```
