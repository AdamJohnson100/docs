2017-48.x release highlights:
- Wavefront UI now uses Project Clarity visual theme.
- Improved Query Builder user experience
- Improved series matching
- Other improvements

## Wavefront UI and Project Clarity

Wavefront now uses the open source Clarity visual design for a consistent, user friendly experience. This change includes introduction of the new Carbon Black theme, a replacement for the Wavefront Dark Theme.

See https://vmware.github.io/clarity/.

## Improved Series Matching

- A new query language element, `by`, allows you to create join-by-point-tags queries. You can use the `by` element to focus the query that might otherwise be too broad to result in a match.
- If you use a boolean query language operator such as `and`, the query language now flips the two items if it can't find a result using the original query.

## Improved Query Builder User Experience

Query Builder helps users get started with the query language through a guided user experience. The Query Builder enables you to quickly build and run your first queries. As you use Query Builder, you can see the ts() expressions you are building â€“ which helps you learn the query language.

In earlier releases, the ts() Query Editor was also enabled when the Query Builder was open. Users were confused about where to enter information. In this release, Wavefront displays the query being created when the Query Builder is open, but you cannot edit the query when you are in Query Builder mode.

As before, you switch to the Query Editor at any time by clicking the Query Builder icon to turn off Query Builder.

**Note** You cannot turn on Query Builder for queries you have created or edited using the Query Editor.

## Other Improvements

- Source tagging API now ignores system tags.
