2018-18.x release highlights:
* Improved event performance
* Miscellaneous improvements

## Improved Event Performance
This release includes several improvements to event performance. The improvements are especially noticable if you don't use wildcards and you don't use `NOT`.

We do not support more than 1000 ongoing user events.

This release also tracks more events than 2018-10.x and 2018.14.x. See [When Does a Query Return Events](https://docs-dev.wavefront.com/events_queries.html#when-does-an-event-query-return-events)


## Miscellaneous Improvements
* For alert targets of type `webhook`, custom header maximum size has been increased to 2048.
* The documentation now includes reference pages for many of the `ts()` query language functions. See the [Query Language Reference list](http://docs-dev.wavefront.com/label_reference%20page.html).
* The documentation now includes Overview and Setup information that is extracted from the in-product documentation for each integration. See the [Integrations List](http://docs-dev.wavefront.com/label_integrations%20list.html).
