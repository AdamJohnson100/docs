2018-18.x release highlights:
* Improved event performance
* Miscellaneous improvements

## Improved Event Performance
This release includes several improvements to event performance. The improvements are especially noticable if you don't use wildcards and you don't use `NOT`.

You cannot create more than 1000 ongoing user events.

This release also tracks more events than 2018-10.x and 2018.14.x. See [When Does an Event Query Return Events?](http://docs.wavefront.com/events_queries.html#when-does-an-event-query-return-events)


## Miscellaneous Improvements
* For alert targets of type `webhook`, custom header maximum size  has been increased to 2048.
* The `align()` function supports an additional parameter, `bw`, which allows you to use bucket window time.
* The [Query Language Reference](http://docs.wavefront.com/query_language_reference.html) now has links to reference pages for many of the functions. We plan on having a page for each function soon.
* The documentation now includes the Overview and Setup information that is included with our in-product integrations in an [integrations list](http://docs-dev.wavefront.com/label_integrations%20list.html)
