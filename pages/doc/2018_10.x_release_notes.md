2018-10.x release highlights:
- Azure cloud monitoring
- Direct data ingestion supports sending data directly to Wavefront instead of to the Wavefront proxy.
- Registered Queries
- New Functions and Parameters:
  - `mdiff()` - Returns the difference between the value of an expression and the value of the same expression at a specified time in the past.
  - `mseriescount()` - Moving count of series aggregated by groups over a time window
  - `vw` - View window parameter. For example, you can now use `mavg(1vw, <exp>)` to have the `timeWindow` of `mavg` adjust automatically to your chart time range.
- Predictive Functions
  - You can pan chart windows into the future and use `hideBefore` and `hideAfter` to further refine the display.
  - Use `hw` and `lead` for Holt-Winters prediction.
  - Use `arima` for ARIMA prediction.
  - The new `lead` function returns an expression that is time shifted by `timeWindow `into the past.

## Azure Cloud Monitoring

A full-featured integration with Microsoft Azure is available in this release. We will add more dashboards to this integration over the next few weeks.

## Direct Data Ingestion

With direct ingestion, you can send data directly to the Wavefront service. This approach has some benefits and some drawbacks.

Details on sending data or files directly and on best practices will become available soon. The current documentation set includes the [Data Ingestion API](api_data_ingestion.html).

## Registered Queries

Registered queries support ingesting new metrics from existing queries. In the Wavefront UI, select **Browse > Registered Queries** to see currently available registered queries.

This feature allows you to save the results for an expensive query so that you don't have tu rerun the query each time you want to graph the historic value. Registered queries behave similar to alerts. You must use functions like `aliasSource`, `aliasMetric`, or `taggify` to ensure that the resulting new series don't conflict with the series of the original query.

Wavefront charges for registered queries on a per-pps basis.

## New Functions and Parameters

We added the following new functions and parameters in this release:

-`mdiff()`-- Returns the difference between the value of **expression** and the value of **expression timeWindow** ago, for example the difference between **expression** and **expression** 5 minutes ago. This is a raw function, so it does not interpolate the points before doing the subtraction.
- `mseriescount()`-- Returns the number of series reporting over a time window. For example, `mseriescount(60m, ts(my.metric))` returns, at each point, the number of series reporting over the last 60 minutes. This function is always raw.
- `vw` -- Allows you to specify the window that you are currently looking at. For example, `1vw` is 1 view window length. If you look at a 30-minute window and specify `1vw`, it's equivalent to 30 minutes. If you specify `4vw` for a 30-minute window, it's 2 hours.

This release also includes two predictive functions, `hw` and `arima`, and several enabling functions (`lead()` `hideBefore()` and `hideAfter()`), discussed next.

See the [Query Language Reference](query_language_reference.html). Detailed documentation for the predictive functions will become available soon.


## Predictive Functions and Associated Changes

Predictive analysis can help you with capacity planning, forecasting, and more. To support predictive analysis, this release includes the following features and functions:

* You can now pan the chart window into the future.
* The `hideBefore` or `hideAfter` functions hide data before or after a specified time. For example, `hideBefore(10m)` means hide data that’s older than 10 minutes and
`hideAfter(10m)` means hide data that’s newer than 10 minutes ago.
* You can use the Holt-Winters algorithm, also called [Exponential Smoothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing) to perform prediction on seasonal time series. The `hw` and `lead` functions support Holt-Winters
* You can use the [ARIMA algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average) to predict future points in a series. The `arima` function supports ARIMA.
* Use the `lead` function to return an expression that is time shifted by `timeWindow `into the past, to enable comparison of an expression with its own future behavior. For example, `lead(3h, ts(my.metric))` returns each point from the expression 3 hours earlier than its true timestamp.

Predictive functions smooth out existing data to arrive at the prediction, so you might see a fairly jagged line in your chart become almost completely straight. However, the line  shows the trend of your metrics, for example, you might see that metrics you ingest increase over time.

See the [Predictive Functions Reference](query_language_reference.html#predictive-functions). Detailed documentation for the predictive functions will become available soon.
