summary: Learn how to integrate authentication providers with Wavefront.

Wavefront supports SSO authentication with ADFS, Azure AD, Google, OneLogin, and Okta.

To configure an integration with one of these providers, follow the instructions in the built-in integration.

Once a user has been successfully authenticated, [authorization](permissions_overview.html) for that user is controlled within Wavefront.
