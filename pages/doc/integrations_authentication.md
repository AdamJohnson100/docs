summary: Learn how to integrate authentication providers with Wavefront.
---

Wavefront supports SSO authentication with [ADFS](adfs.html), [Azure AD](azure_ad.html), [Google](google.html), [OneLogin](onelogin.html), and [Okta](okta.html).

To configure an integration with one of these providers, follow the instructions in the built-in integration.

Once a user has been successfully authenticated, [authorization](permissions_overview.html) for that user is controlled within Wavefront.
