Wavefront offers new insights for your network of systems through the use of charts. While charts provide a window into your company's data, dashboards offer you a way to prioritize and group those windows in a meaningful way. By creating dashboards, you can quickly compare different data sets, alter time windows for all data sets, and save those windows for future use.
 
While some customers can have hundreds of existing dashboards in their environment, typical Wavefront users use a smaller subset of dashboards each day. This makes the ability to quickly search for relevant dashboards even more important. The following information describes how to search for dashboards in the All Dashboards page and from an existing dashboard.
 
## Searching in the All Dashboards Page
 
The All Dashboards page provides you with a single location to view all of your company's existing dashboards. You navigate to the All Dashboards page by selecting **Dashboards > All Dashboards** on the task bar.
 
The list of existing dashboards initially display in alphabetical order. You can scroll through the list to find a particular dashboard.  However, the most common way to find existing dashboards is searching by name, tags, or favorites.
 
If you know a string in the name, dashboard description, URL, or tag, you can use the Search field located at the top of the page. For example, typing **metrics** into the Search field results in a list of dashboards with 'metrics' in any of those dashboard properties.
 
Once you finish a search you can save the search by clicking the **Save** button.  The filter bar at the left contains a set of default saved searches and your custom saved searches.
 
## Filtering Dashboards Using Tags
 
[Tags](tags_overview) enable you to group together dashboards that may be related in some way. Common groupings include teams (ops, developers, IT), users (Bob, Jane), or applications. Dashboard tags can be viewed by every user within your company. When you look at the list of existing dashboards on the All Dashboards page, a tag appears as a gray labeled icon ![tag](images/tag.png) underneath the name of the dashboard.

You can use the tags in the filter bar to filter the list of existing dashboards. To filter the displayed list of dashboards, click a dashboard tag. You can apply multiple tag filters to the list of dashboards by holding down the Ctrl or command key while clicking multiple tags.

## Searching from a Dashboard
If you are viewing an existing dashboard and you want to navigate to a different dashboard, then you use the Search Dashboards field at the upper right of the task bar. The Search Dashboards field searches any string within a dashboard name or URL.
