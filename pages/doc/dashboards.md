Dashboards group a set of related [charts](charts). All charts in a dashboard share [display
preferences](#prefs), [variables](dashboards_variables), and can share [events](events_charts#dashboards_events). Within
dashboards you use [sections](#sections) to further organize charts.

To view and manage dashboards, select **Dashboards > All Dashboards**.

All users can [search](dashboards_searching) and [interact](dashboards_interacting) with dashboards. You must have [Dashboard Management permission](permissions) to [manage dashboards](dashboards_managing). If you do not have permission, UI menu selections and buttons required to perform the tasks are not visible.
