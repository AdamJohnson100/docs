Dashboards group a set of related [charts](charts.html). Within dashboards you use [sections](dashboards_managing.html#sections) to further organize charts.

All charts in a dashboard share [display preferences](dashboards_managing.html#prefs), [variables](dashboards_variables.html), and can share [events](charts_events_displaying.html#controlling-events-overlays). 

To view and manage dashboards, select **Dashboards > All Dashboards**.

All users can [search](dashboards_searching.html) and [interact](dashboards_interacting.html) with dashboards.
