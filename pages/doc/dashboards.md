## Interacting with Dashboards and Charts

Wavefront provides many ways to [work with dashboards and charts](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1067).
You can change time windows, share links, overlay events, and zoom in and out.

## Creating Charts

[Charts](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1064) are the primary way you view the status of your metrics. You add [ts() queries](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1019)
to view and perform operations on metrics and configure [chart options](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1158) for the most helpful view.

## Creating Dashboards

Dashboards group a set of related charts. Within dashboards use can use [sections](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1068#jive_content_id_Configuring_Dashboard_Sections)
to organize charts and [variables](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1062) to share ts() queries across charts.
