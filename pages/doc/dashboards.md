Wavefront offers new insights for your network of systems through the use of [charts](charts.html). While charts provide a window into your company's data, dashboards offer you a way to prioritize and group those windows in a meaningful way. Within dashboards you use [sections](dashboards_managing.html#sections) to further organize charts. By creating dashboards, you can quickly compare different data sets, alter time windows for all data sets, and save those windows for future use.

In addition, all charts in a dashboard share [display preferences](dashboards_managing.html#prefs), [variables](dashboards_variables.html), and can share [events](charts_events_displaying.html#controlling-events-overlays). 

To view and manage dashboards, select **Dashboards > All Dashboards**.

All users can search and [interact](dashboards_interacting.html) with dashboards. 

{% include shared/permissions.html entity="dashboards" entitymgmt="Dashboard" %}

## Dashboard Types

Wavefront has two types of dashboards: system and user. 

System dashboards are installed by [Integrations](integrations.html) and include:

- [Tour dashboards](dashboards_getting_started.html#tour-dashboards)
- [Tutorial dashboards](dashboards_getting_started.html#tutorial-dashboards)
- [Wavefront System dashboard](wavefront_monitoring.html)

{% include shared/system_dashboard.html %}

{% include shared/searching.html entity="Dashboards" entities="dashboards" %}

### Searching from a Dashboard
If you are viewing an existing dashboard and you want to navigate to a different dashboard, then you use the Search Dashboards field at the upper right of the task bar. The Search Dashboards field searches any string within a dashboard name or URL.
