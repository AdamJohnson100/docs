## Creating a Chart

Charts are the primary way you view the status of your metrics. You add ts() queries to view particular metrics and can
select the chart display options to provide the most helpful view.

For details, see:

  - [Getting Started with the ts() Query Language](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1019)
  - [Creating a Chart](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1064)


## Creating a Dashboard

Dashboards collect a set of related charts. You can create a chart from an existing chart or starting with a blank chart.

For details, see [Creating a Dashboard](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1068#jive_content_id_Creating_a_Dashboard)

## Interacting with Dashboards and Charts

Wavefront provides many mechanisms for interacting with dashboards and charts. You can change time windows, share links
to live dashboards and charts, overlay events, and zoom in and out.
