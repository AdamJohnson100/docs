## Description

The `mdiff()` (moving diff) function returns the difference between the expression's current value and the expression's value `timeWindow` ago.

For example: `expression` minus `expression's value 5 minutes ago`.

This function does not interpolate the points before doing the subtraction.

We created the `mdiff()` function to return a moving sum of rates. Users found it difficult to understand what a moving sum of rates is.

## Examples

In the following image, the value at 5pm is 462 and the value 15 minutes before that was 258, resulting in a difference of 204
