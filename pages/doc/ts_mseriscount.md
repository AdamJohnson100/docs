<tr>
<td markdown="span">[timeWindow](query_language_reference.html#query-elements)</td>
<td >A clock/calendar time measurement (1s, 1m, 1h, 1d, 1w), time relative to the window length (vw), or time relative to the bucket size (bw) of the chart. Default is minutes if no unit is specified.</td></tr>

<td>Optional 'group by' parameter for organizing the time series into subgroups and then returning a count for each subgroup.
Use one or more parameters to group by metric names, source names, source tag names, point tag names, values for a particular point tag key, or any combination of these items. Specify point tag keys by name.</td>

## Description

The `mseriescount()` (moving series count) function returns the aggregated number of series reporting during the specified time window. For example, `mseriescount(60m, ts(my.metric))` returns the number of series reporting over the last 60 minutes.

This function is especially helpful if new series are constantly spun up and taken down and the number of reporting series changes over time. For example, you could use this function to check whether you have the right number of hosts in a cluster. You could also write an alert that checks whether you have enough hosts.

Here's how you use different counting functions:
* `count()` - returns the number of series reporting at each point in time.
* `mcount()` - returns the number of data pointsÂ in a time window
* `mseriescount()` - returns the number of series reporting during the specified time window


For example, one customer used `mseriescount` in an alert that fired when the build number changed in any of a set of service pods. To do that, the alert:
* Extracts the `build` point tag
* Checks how many `build` point tags there are in the last hour, day, or week.
* Alerts if it's not 1.

## Examples

The following very simple example illustrates that 11 time series with `source=app-1*` and 2 time series with `source=app-2*` reported in the specified time window. If the number of time series changes frequently, using this function gets you more interesting results.
