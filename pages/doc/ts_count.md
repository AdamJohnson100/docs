## Summary
```
count(<expression>[,metrics|sources|sourceTags|tags|<pointTagKey>])
```

At each time interval, the `count()` function adds together the number of reporting sources for each represented metric, and displays that value on the chart. If there are gaps of data in the expression, they are first filled in using interpolation if at least 1 known value is available. Use `rawcount` if you don't want interpolation.

## Description

Like all aggregation functions, `count()` usually returns a single line when used without additional arguments.

To provide the aggregate value, Wavefront interpolates all queries at a time slice if at least one real reported data value is present.

### Grouping

With the optional `sources`, `metrics`, `sourceTags`, or `tags` arguments, you can 'group by' that attribute. You can use more than one argument, and you can specify one or more point tags by name.

### Interpolation
To provide an aggregate value that our customers typically expect, Wavefront attempts to interpolate all queries at a time slice if at least one real reported data value is present.

For a live-view chart, where interpolation is not possible because no new points have been reported yet, Wavefront associates the last known reported value for all queries if a real reported data value is present. We apply the last known reported value only if interpolation canâ€™t occur AND the last known reported point has been reported within the last 15% of the query time in the chart window.

## Examples

The following examples contrast the result you get for two different types of servers. We're using a Single Stat View chart to first get a count of all servers that have a sample requests latency and the source `app-1*` (11 servers). Then we get a count of all servers that have the source `app-2*` While the example is a bit contrived, it illustrates how to use the function.

![count 2](images/ts_count2.png)

The following example groups all sources whose name starts with `"app-1*"` by the `env` point tag. The Stacked Area chart shows that 1 server is tagged with `dev` and 10 servers are tagged with `production`.

## Caveats

Count is not a static number, it will change if the number of hosts reporting the metric changes. For some types of analysis, it is better to use `avg()` instead of `count()`.
