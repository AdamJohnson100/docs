## Summary
```
count(<expression>[,metrics|sources|sourceTags|pointTags|<pointTagKey>])
```

Returns the number of time series that are reporting values.
If there are gaps of data in the expression, they are first filled in using interpolation if at least 1 known value is available. Use `rawcount` if you don't want interpolation.

## Description

At each time interval, the `count()` function adds together the number of reporting sources for each represented metric, and displays that value as a line on the chart.

To provide the aggregate value, Wavefront interpolates all queries at a time slice if at least one real reported data value is present.

### Grouping

Like all aggregation functions, `count()` returns a single series of results by default.  

You can include a 'group by' parameter to obtain separate counts for groups of time series that share common metric names, source names, source tags, point tags, or values for a particular point tag key. 
The function returns a separate series of results corresponding to each group.

You can specify multiple 'group by' parameters to group the time series based on multiple characteristics. For example, `count(ts("cpu.cpu*"), metrics, Customer)` first groups by metric names, and then groups by the values of the `Customer` point tag.


### Interpolation
To provide an aggregate value that our customers typically expect, Wavefront attempts to interpolate all queries at a time slice if at least one real reported data value is present.

For a live-view chart, where interpolation is not possible because no new points have been reported yet, Wavefront associates the last known reported value for all queries if a real reported data value is present. We apply the last known reported value only if interpolation canâ€™t occur AND the last known reported point has been reported within the last 15% of the query time in the chart window.

## Examples

The following examples contrast the result you get for two different types of servers. We're using a Single Stat View chart to first get a count of all servers that have a sample requests latency and the source `app-1*` (11 servers). Then we get a count of all servers that have the source `app-2*` While the example is a bit contrived, it illustrates how to use the function.

![count 2](images/ts_count2.png)

The following example groups all sources whose name starts with `"app-1*"` by the `env` point tag. The Stacked Area chart shows that 1 server is tagged with `dev` and 10 servers are tagged with `production`.

## Caveats

Count is not a static number, it will change if the number of hosts reporting the metric changes. For some types of analysis, it is better to use `avg()` instead of `count()`.
