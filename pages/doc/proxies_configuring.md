This document describes Wavefront proxy 4.6 configuration options. For changes since previous proxy versions, see [Wavefront Proxy Version History](proxies_version_history).

## Installing a Proxy

To install a proxy, follow the directions in [Installing Wavefront Proxies](proxies_installing). The installation procedures perform basic configuration. For advanced configuration, see the options in the next section.

## Configuration Options

The Wavefront proxy configuration is maintained in `/etc/wavefront/wavefront-proxy/wavefront.conf`. Besides the `server` and `hostname` properties, the configuration file offers a variety of other options for changing how the proxy processes your data. None of these need to be changed from their default values, but can be adjusted for your particular needs. After changing a configuration option, [restart the proxy service](proxies_managing#starting-and-stopping-a-proxy).

## Data Buffering

If the Wavefront proxy is unable to post received data to the Wavefront servers, it buffers the data to disk across a number of buffer files, and then tries to resend the points once the connection to the Wavefront servers is available again. If this buffering occurs, you'll see lines like this in `wavefront.log`:

    2013-11-18 18:02:35,061 WARN  [com.wavefront.daemon.QueuedSshDaemonService] current retry queue sizes: [1/0/0/0]

By default, there are 4 threads (and 4 buffer files) waiting to retry points once the connections are up; this line shows how many blocks of points have been stored by each thread (in this case, the first thread has 1 block of queued points, while the second, third, and fourth threads all have 0 blocks). These lines are only printed when there are points in the queue; you'll never see a line with all 0's in the queue sizes. Once the connection to the Wavefront servers has been established, and all the threads have sent the past data to us, you'll see a single line like this in wavefront.log:

    2013-11-18 18:59:46,665 WARN [com.wavefront.daemon.QueuedSshDaemonService] retry queue has been cleared

## Log Configuration

The Wavefront proxy supports two log files: proxy log and blocked point log. To keep the log file sizes reasonable and avoid filling up the disk with logs, both log files are automatically rotated and purged periodically. You configure the log file locations and rotation rules in `/etc/wavefront/wavefront-proxy/log4j2.xml`. For details on log4j2 configuration, see [Log4j Configuration](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html).

### Proxy Log

By default, proxy log entries are logged to `/var/log/wavefront/wavefront.log`. The log file is rolled over every day and when its size reaches 100MB. When there are 30 log files, older files are deleted. 

### Blocked Point Log

You can log raw blocked points in a separate log from the proxy log. Logging of blocked points is disabled by default. To enable logging block points, edit the log4j2 configuration file and uncomment the blocked points file appender:

    <!--
        <AppenderRef ref="BlockedPointsFile"/>
    -->

By default, blocked point entries are logged to `/var/log/wavefront/wavefront-blocked-points.log` and the block point log file is rolled over every day and when its size reaches 100MB. When there are 31 log files, older files are deleted.
