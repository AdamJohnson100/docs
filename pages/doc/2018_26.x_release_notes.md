2018-26.x release highlights:
* Support for histograms
* Option to include alert image in alert notification
* Miscellaneous improvements


## Support for Histograms
Wavefront histograms let you compute, store, and use distributions of metrics rather than single metrics. Histograms are useful for high-velocity metrics about your applications and infrastructure â€“ particularly those gathered across many distributed sources.

**Note** The histogram feature requires a separate license and is not enabled on your cluster by default.

See [Wavefront Histograms](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies_histograms.html)

## Option to Include Alert Image in Alert Notification

You can now set up alert notifications so that alert recipients receive a snapshot of the chart in the notification.

We support alert images for email, Pagerduty, and Webhooks alert notifications. See XX for sample setup instructions for an email alert target.

## Miscellaneous Improvements

* Improvement of `mpercentile()` performance, especially with large moving time windows.
* Calls to `at("end", windowWidth())` now return the correct value.
