2018-26.x release highlights:
* Support for histograms
* Option to include alert image in alert notification
* Miscellaneous improvements


## Support for Histograms
Wavefront histograms let you compute, store, and use distributions of metrics rather than single metrics. Histograms are useful for high-velocity metrics about your applications and infrastructure â€“ particularly those gathered across many distributed sources.

**Note** The histogram feature requires a separate license and is not enabled on your cluster by default.

See [Wavefront Histograms](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies_histograms.html)

## Option to Include Alert Image in Alert Notification

We now include an image of the chart that triggered the alert in alert notifications. In many cases, the image is included by default.
* For out-of-the-box email and PagerDuty alert targets that you specify on the **Create Alert** page, alert notifications will include the image.
* If you upgrade to 2018.26, and you create a custom alert target on the **Create Alert Target** page, the template for the alert target will include the image.
* For already existing custom alert targets, you have to modify the template to include the image.  See XX for sample setup instructions for an email alert target.

**Note** We do not include an image if the alert fires for more than 1 minute. 

## Miscellaneous Improvements

* Improvement of `mpercentile()` performance, especially with large moving time windows.
* Calls to `at("end", windowWidth())` now return the correct value.
