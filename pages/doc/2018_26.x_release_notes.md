2018-26.x release highlights:
* Support for histograms
* Option to include alert image in alert notification
* Miscellaneous improvements


## Support for Histograms
Wavefront histograms let you compute, store, and use distributions of metrics rather than single metrics. Histograms are useful for high-velocity metrics about your applications and infrastructure â€“ particularly those gathered across many distributed sources.

**Note** The histogram feature requires a separate license and is not enabled on your cluster by default.

See [Wavefront Histograms](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies_histograms.html)

## Option to Include Alert Image in Alert Notification

We now include an image of the chart that triggered the alert in alert notifications. In many cases, the image is included by default.
* For out-of-the-box email and PagerDuty alert targets that you specify on the **Create Alert** page, alert notifications will include the image.
* If you use version 2018-26.x or later, and you create a custom alert target on the **Create Alert Target** page, the template for the alert target will include the image.
* If you created custom alert targets before version 2018-26.x was released, you have to modify the template to include the image.  See [Adding Chart Images to Older Custom Alert Targets](alert_target_customizing.html#adding-chart-images-to-older-custom-alert-targets) for sample setup instructions for an email alert target.

**Note** We do not include the alert image if the alert query takes more than one minute to execute.

## Miscellaneous Improvements

* Improvement of `mpercentile()` performance, especially with large moving time windows.
* Calls to `at("end", windowWidth())` now return the correct value.
