## AI Genie Anomaly Detection and Forecasting

* Select **Anomaly Detection** to highlight anomalous behavior. This tab wraps the [`anomalous()` function](ts_anomalous.html) around your query.
* Select **Forecasting** to view a forecast for your current query. You can set a time window and confidence bands.

## Enhancements to Wavefront Authorization

We've made multiple enhancements to [Wavefront authorization](authorization.html):
* [Groups](users_groups.html) make it easy to quickly make changes such as assigning permissions to many users at once.
* The UI and docs have been refactored so users with `Users & Groups` permissions can create groups and manage the users and permissions for groups.
* Permission names that are visible in the UI are now more consistent and intuitive.
* To assign permissions to new users, you can:
  - Assign permissions to the Everyone group, or create a group with default permissions and assign each user to that group (recommended).
  - Set permissions for new users as before.
* The [Wavefront REST API](wavefront_api.html) includes a new UserGroup object.

## New Access-Based Authorization

Customers have asked for access-based authorization, and we're making it available for dashboards in this release.
* A new Everyone group becomes available. All users are always in the Everyone group.
* By default, all users in the Everyone group can view and modify all dashboards.
* Users with `Users & Groups` permission can turn on a security preference. After that, only the dashboard creator and the Super Admin user can:
  - View and modify **New** dashboards.
  - Give other users View or View & Modify access to individual new dashboards.
  Users with View & Modify access can then also invite other users to view or view and modify the dashboard.
* A new Super Admin user can share dashboards created while the Security preference was in place. Initially, each cluster has only one Super Admin user, who can invite other users to become Super Admin user.

## Enhanced Application Observability and New Wavefront SDKs

Wavefront has made a set of SDKs available on Github. These SDKs are not directly tied to a release. They support instrumenting applications at different levels of your stack and sending them to Wavefront.
