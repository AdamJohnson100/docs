Wavefront supports the ability to embed an interactive chart outside of Wavefront. For the required permission, see [Embed Charts Permission](permissions_misc.html#embed-charts-permission).

To embed a chart:

1. Open the chart you want to embed in the chart editor and click the embed icon (`<\>`).
