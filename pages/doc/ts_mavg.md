## Summary

```
mavg(<timeWindow>, <expression>)
```

Returns the moving average of each series over `timeWindow`.

## Parameters

<table>
<tbody>
<thead>
<tr><th width="20%">Parameter</th><th width="80%">Description</th></tr>
</thead>
<tr>
<td>timeWindow</td>
<td>A window of time specified in seconds, minutes, hours, days or weeks (1s, 1m, 1h, 1d, 1w). If the unit is not specified, the default is minutes. Example: 1h.
<div><strong>NOTE</strong>:If the series stops reporting, then <code>mcount()</code> returns the number of data points for 2x the duration of <code>&lt;timeWindow&gt;</code>.</div></td></tr>
<tr>
<td markdown="span"> [expression](query_language_reference.html#expressions)</td>
<td>A ts expression, a constant, or a wildcard.</td>

## Description

The `mavg()` function computes the moving average of each data stream over a shifting time window. For example, `mavg(60m, ts(my.metric))` returns, at each point, the moving average over the last 60 minutes for each series in expression.

Here's how to select your averaging function:

* Use `mavg()` to see the moving averageÂ in a specified time window.
* Use `avg()` to see the average (the mean).
* Use `median()` to see the median. Using `median` is preferred if there are a lot of outliers.
* Use `mpercentile()` with a percentile of 50 to see the moving median.


## Example

Let's say you have the following expression:

`mavg(48h, ts(my.metric))`

Assume `ts(my.metric)` reports data values once per hour, but only started reporting data 24 hours ago. `mavg()` will add up all reported points within the last 48 hours and divide by the number of reported points (not number of hours). So in that example `mavg()` divides by 24 not by 48, because technically, we have only 24 reported points within the last 48 hours.

The following example shows the requests latency for a single app server (app-1):

And here's what we see when we apply `mavg()`.

## Caveats

At times, using `msum` can get you the information you want. In that case, use `msum` because performance is better.
