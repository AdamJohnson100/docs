## Summary
```
avg(expression[,metrics|sources|sourceTags|pointTags|<pointTagKey])
```
Returns the average (the mean) of all series. If there are gaps of data in the expression, they are first filled in using interpolation if at least 1 known value is available. Use `rawavg` if you don't want interpolation.

## Description

The `avg()` function takes the average (the mean), at each point in time, of the different time series in the expression. If at least one data value is present at a point in time, then all other existing time series in the query will be interpolated before the average is computed (if possible).

The `avg`, `mavg` and `median` functions can help you understand the tendency of the data.

* Use `avg` or `mavg` to get the mean (average), that is, the number in the middle of a set of values.
* Use `mendian` to be less sensitive to outliers. Even a single outlier can affect the result of `avg` and `mavg`. Use `mpercentile` with a percentile of 50 to get the moving median.


### Grouping

Like all aggregation functions, `avg()` returns a single series of results by default.  

You can include a 'group by' parameter to obtain separate averages for groups of time series that share common metric names, source names, source tags, point tags, or values for a particular point tag key. 
The function returns a separate series of results corresponding to each group.

You can specify multiple 'group by' parameters to group the time series based on multiple characteristics. For example, `avg(ts("cpu.cpu*"), metrics, Customer)` first groups by metric names, and then groups by the values of the `Customer` point tag.


### Interpolation
To provide an aggregate value that our customers typically expect, Wavefront attempts to interpolate all queries at a time slice if at least one real reported data value is present.

For a live-view chart, where interpolation is not possible because no new points have been reported yet, Wavefront associates the last known reported value for all queries if a real reported data value is present. We apply the last known reported value only if interpolation canâ€™t occur AND the last known reported point has been reported within the last 15% of the query time in the chart window.

## Examples
The following example shows the data for `sample.requests.loadavg`.

When we apply `avg` we get a single line.

We can group by the `env` point tag to see the differences between the dev and production servers.

## Caveats

Using [`rawavg()`](ts_rawavg.html) instead of `avg()` can significantly improve query performance because `rawavg()` does not perform interpolation.
