## Summary
```
avg(expression[,metrics|sources|sourceTags|tags|<pointTagKey])
```
Returns the average (the mean) of all series. If there are gaps of data in the expression, they are first filled in using interpolation if at least 1 known value is available. Use `rawavg` if you don't want interpolation.

## Parameters

<td>Optional additional expressions to include in the average. </td>

## Description

The `avg()` function takes the average (the mean), at each point in time, of the different time series in the expression. If at least one data value is present at a point in time, then all other existing time series in the query will be interpolated before the average is computed (if possible).

The `avg`, `mavg` and `median` functions can help you understand the tendency of the data.

* Use `avg` or `mavg` to get the mean (average), that is, the number in the middle of a set of values.
* Use `mendian` to be less sensitive to outliers. Even a single outlier can affect the result of `avg` and `mavg`. Use `mpercentile` with a percentile of 50 to get the moving median.

Like all aggregation functions, `avg` usually returns a single line when used without additional arguments.

### Grouping

With the optional `sources`, `metrics`, `sourceTags`, or `tags` arguments, you can 'group by' that attribute. You can use more than one argument, and you can specify one or more point tags by name.

### Interpolation
To provide an aggregate value that our customers typically expect, Wavefront attempts to interpolate all queries at a time slice if at least one real reported data value is present.

For a live-view chart, where interpolation is not possible because no new points have been reported yet, Wavefront associates the last known reported value for all queries if a real reported data value is present. We apply the last known reported value only if interpolation canâ€™t occur AND the last known reported point has been reported within the last 15% of the query time in the chart window.

## Examples
The following example shows the data for `sample.requests.loadavg`.

When we apply `avg` we get a single line.

We can group by the `env` point tag to see the differences between the dev and production servers.

## Caveats

Using [`rawavg()`](ts_rawavg.html) instead of `avg()` can significantly improve query performance because `rawavg()` does not perform interpolation.
