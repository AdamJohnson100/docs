One way of getting your data into Wavefront is taking advantage of a Wavefront integration. [This page](http://docs.wavefront.com/label_integrations%20list.html) lists all built-in integrations and includes some Overview and Setup information for each integrations.

For detailed instructions, log in to Wavefront, find the integration you're interested in, and click the **Setup** tab.

Wavefront doesn't limit you to built-in integrations. You can also get your data into Wavefront by:
* Using a custom integration or setting up one of the [collectd integrations](http://docs.wavefront.com/integrations_collectd.html)
* Using an existing Telegraf plugin
* Converting existing metrics to one of the [supported data formats](/proxies.html#supported-data-formats) and sending them to the Wavefront proxy.
* Instrumenting your application using one of the Wavefront SDKs
* And more!
