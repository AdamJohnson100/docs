Once a user has been successfully authenticated, authorization for that user is controlled within Wavefront. 
Each user has a [default set of permissions](users_managing#setting-default-permissions-for-new-users). 
You must have [User Management permission](permissions_overview.html) to manage users. If you do not have permission, 
UI menu selections and buttons required to perform management tasks are not visible.
