Once a user has been successfully authenticated, authorization for that user is controlled within Wavefront. 
Each user has a [default set of permissions](users_managing#setting-default-permissions-for-new-users) which can be 
modified by a user with [User Management permission](permissions_overview). If you do not have User Management permission, 
UI menu selections and buttons required to perform management tasks are not visible.
