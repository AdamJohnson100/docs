Event filters allow you to limit which events are returned from events() queries.

<tr><th>Filter</th><th>Description</th><th>Example</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>alertId</td>
<td>The ID of the alert that created the event.</td>
<td>events(<span style="color: #00BCD4;">alertId=1411189741192</span>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>alertTag</td>
<td>A tag associated with the alert that generated the event.</td>
<td>events(<span style="color: #00BCD4;">alertTag="ops"</span>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eventTag</td>
<td>A tag associated with the event.</td>
<td>events(<span style="color: #00BCD4">eventTag="codepushes"</span>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>name</td>
<td>The name of the event. Manually created events have a unique name, while events generated by an alert have the 
same name as the associated alert. The name filter requires quotes if spaces exist in the name.</td>
<td>events(<span style="color: #00BCD4;">name="Request Latency too high"</span>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>severity</td>
<td markdown="span">The classification of the user event or the [severity of alert](alerts_managing.html#severity) that 
generated the event. User event classification levels are severe, warn, info, and unclassified. 
Although an event can be left as unclassified, the severity filter does not accept unclassified as a valid value.
</td>
<td>events(<span style="color: #00BCD4;">severity="info"</span>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>source or tag</td>
<td>The source or source tag associated with the alert that generated the event. 
The source filter allows you to display events generated by an alert based on a single source or set of sources. 
The tag filter works the same way, but allows you to specify a source tag instead of a source name.</td>
<td>events(<span style="color: #00BCD4;">source="app-*"</span> <span style="color: #eb7a3d;"> or </span><span style="color: #00BCD4;">tag="dc2"</span>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td id="subtype">subtype</td>
<td>
The subtype of event of type alert-detail: failing, recovered.
</td>
<td>events(<span style="color: #00BCD4;">subtype="failing"</span>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>target
</td>
<td markdown="span">The target of the alert that generated the event. The list of targets associated with an alert are considered a single string. 
  If you want to identify a single target within that string, then you must use wildcards. For example, if the notification field contains: john.doe@example.com, jane.doe@example.com, pd:fbw21c9ee0219473w2179r4t23f8c34, to use jane.doe@example.com as the target filter, specify the email as \*jane.doe@example.com\*.</td>
<td>events(<span style="color: #00BCD4;">target="*jane.doe@example.com*</span>")</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td id="type">type</td>
<td>The type of an event. There are system-generated event types: alert, maintenanceWindow, alert-detail, credentials-error, 
alert-created, alert-updated, alert-deleted, dashboard-deleted, 
maintenancewindow-created, maintenancewindow-updated, maintenancewindow-deleted and you can optionally assign a type to a user event. The value requires quotes if it contains spaces or starts with a wildcard.
