{% include note.html content='System dashboards are _read-only_ so Wavefront can easily update them. If you want to make
your own version of a system dashboard, you can [clone](dashboards_managing.html#cloning-a-dashboard) it providing a new dashboard
URL and then make changes to the clone. If you have a dashboard with the same URL as a system dashboard, when Wavefront
deploys the system dashboard we save a copy of your dashboard and add "-clone" to the URL and "(Cloned)" to the name.' %}
