{% include note.html content='[System dashboards](dashboards.html#dashboard-types) are _read-only_ so Wavefront can easily update them. If you want to make
your own version of a system dashboard, you can [clone](dashboards_managing.html#cloning-a-dashboard) it providing a new dashboard
URL and then make changes to the clone. If you have a dashboard with the same URL as a system dashboard, when Wavefront
deploys the system dashboard a copy of your dashboard is saved with "-clone" added to the URL and "(Cloned)" added to the name.' %}
