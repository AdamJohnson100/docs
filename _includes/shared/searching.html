## Searching {{ include.entity }}

While some Wavefront instances can have hundreds of {{ include.entities }}, typical Wavefront users
use a smaller subset of {{ include.entities }} each day.  This makes the ability to quickly search for relevant {{
include.entities }} vital. Wavefront offers many [features](wavefront_searching.html) to help you organize and search for {{
include.entities }}.
